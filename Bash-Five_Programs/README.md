Each .sh script does a different thing:
  Questionnaire: Asks the user some questions about themselves and then prints out a collated message
  Countdown: Counts down from an argument number given when run all the way to 0 at 1 second intervals
  Bingo: Chooses a random number between 0 and 75 and outputs the corresponding BINGO letter
  Fortune: Takes a question from the user and outputs a random answer

To run any of them individually, type ./ and then the file name
  ex: ./countdown.sh

To run all of them sequentially run the five script:
  ./five.sh
